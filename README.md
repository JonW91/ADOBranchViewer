# ADOBranchViewer

This project is for managing Azure DevOPs Projects. 

The current workflow in ADO is slow and ineffecient as the branch management UI does not allow all branches in all projects to be viewed in one place.

This application aims to:

- Fetch the list of all projects and their branches.
- Display where more than 1 main/master branch exists.
- Display the last commit date.
- Display the active/stale type.
- Display how many behind/infront.
